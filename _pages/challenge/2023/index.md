## Introduction
The 5th LSVOS challenge will be held in conjunction with [ICCV 2023](https://iccv2023.thecvf.com/) in Paris, France. In this edition of the workshop and challenge, we are combining the classic [YouTube-VOS](https://youtube-vos.org/) benchmark with the newly introduced [VOST](https://www.vostdataset.org/) dataset. VOST focuses on complex object transformations, such as egg cracking or molding of clay, which break the assumptions behind existing methods and require rethinking the basic design principles behind them. The combined challenge will be held in conjunction with video instance segmentation and referring video object segmentation YouTube-VOS competitions. In addition, we will hold a series of talks by the leading experts in video understating. The workshop will culminate in a round table discussion, in which speakers will debate the future of video object representations.
