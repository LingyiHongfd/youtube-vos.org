We propose an online video segmentation method for temporal images. Our online video segmentation with Mask-RCNN and Re-id (OVSMAR) model includes an online mask propagation module, a Mask-RCNN module and a Object-Reid module. The online mask propagation module takes the warped prediction result of the previous frame together with the optical flow as input, and outputs the segmentation result of the current frame. This process can be trained end-to-end online with continuous images. Starting from weights pre-trained on ImageNet, COCO and PASCAL VOC, we train this module on Youtube Datasets online. We use the Re-id module to retrieve instances which are missing due to occlusion, motion blur, and out of the camera. We use the Mask-RCNN module trained on MS-COCO to find the missing object which similarity is greater than the threshold, then use the Mask-RCNN segmentation result as the coarse prediction of the object for online mask propagation module, and propagate both forward and backward.      With these three modules iteratively applied, our OVSMAR records a global mean (Region Jaccard and Boundary F measure) of 0.678 on valid dataset and 0.672 on test set.
